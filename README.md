### 👋 I'm Samuele, a Physicist and Data Scientist

🔭 I’m currently working on microbial ecology and reduction of Carbon footprint by starting from real mobility data at INFN Padova

🌱 I’m an enthusiast Physicist and Data Scientist with interests in complex systems and theoretical and experimental ecology

🏷️ Some projects i worked on are:

- Study on coexistence and diversity for consumer resource models in a serial dilution setting;
- Comprehensive analysis of a variant of the consumer resource model based on proteome allocation of species, competition among species and its criteria;
- Estimation of incubation period plus reporting time based on COVID-19 mobility and new cases data in Italy. Focus on a time lag analysis in spread and application of restrictions;
- Inference of COVID-19 vaccines effectiveness and uncertainty using Bayesian methods;
- Reconstruction of tracks of particles measured by fast track detectors;
